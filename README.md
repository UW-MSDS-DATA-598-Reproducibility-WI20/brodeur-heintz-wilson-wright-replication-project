## Contents

The purpose of this assignment is to explore the emphasis on reproducibility in scientific research. We will be recreating figures of the 2014 paper, *Marriage and happiness: Providing evidence against a relationship between inequality and happiness*. This paper challenges claims about American happiness, and looks into "happiness drivers" known to change over time. The paper examines the influence of factors such as race and marriage on happiness, and explains how accounting for these factors invalidates claims by a previous paper between the relationship of inequality and happiness. Specifically, our team will be replicating Table 2, a look into demographics and happiness, and Figure 2, a linear investigation of mean happiness and the proportion of the population that is married and white. Since this paper challenges previous claims on the grounds of data control, it is a prime candidate for a meaningful reproduction.
